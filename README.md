## 🎯 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical business problem in the telecom industry.  
This project presents an **end-to-end Machine Learning solution** that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn using historical customer behavior and service usage data.

The goal is to **maximize recall for churn customers**, ensuring that potential churners are identified early so that businesses can take **proactive retention actions**.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo

- **Streamlit Cloud:** https://customer-churn-prediction-agehkjkylrehcwxvpncblh.streamlit.app/
- **Hugging Face Spaces:** 

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Real-time Churn Prediction:** Instant results with probability scores.
- **Risk Categorization:** Automatically flags 'High Risk' vs 'Low Risk' customers.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Proactive Strategies:** Provides business recommendations based on prediction results.

---

## 🧠 Technical Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables (One-Hot), and scaled numerical features.
2. **Imbalance Handling:** Utilized **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the churn vs. non-churn classes.
3. **Model Selection:** Evaluated multiple algorithms, selecting **Gradient Boosting** for its superior Recall and Precision.
4. **Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning to minimize False Negatives (missing a potential churner).

---

## 📊 Model Performance
The model focuses on **Recall** to ensure business stakeholders don't miss at-risk customers:

| Metric | Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | 76% |
| **Recall (Churn Class)** | ~70% |
| **ROC-AUC Score** | 0.83 |

---

## 🧪 Model Comparison & Selection
Multiple models were trained and evaluated, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

Gradient Boosting was selected as the final model due to:
- Superior recall for churn customers
- Strong ROC–AUC performance
- Better handling of non-linear relationships

---

## 🔍 Feature Importance
Understanding which factors drive customer churn is crucial for business strategy. Based on our model, the top 3 drivers are:
1. **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn risk.
2. **Tenure:** Newer customers are more likely to leave than long-term ones.
3. **Monthly Charges:** Higher bills correlate with increased churn probability.

## 💻 Installation & Usage

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Alamin-refat/customer-churn-prediction.git](https://github.com/Alamin-refat/customer-churn-prediction.git)
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
```
### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
This keeps the project dependencies isolated and prevents conflicts:
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries
Install all necessary dependencies listed in the requirements file to ensure the environment is ready:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit Dashboard
Launch the web application locally to interact with the churn prediction model:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

I plan to further enhance this project by implementing the following features:

- [ ] **Advanced Model Implementation:** Experiment with Deep Learning (ANN) and LightGBM to compare with current results.
- [ ] **Model Explainability:** Integrate **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** values to show exactly why a specific customer is flagged as high risk.
- [ ] **Automated Retraining:** Build a pipeline to retrain the model automatically as new customer data becomes available.
- [ ] **Bulk Prediction:** Add a feature to upload a `.csv` file and get churn predictions for thousands of customers at once.
- [ ] **Customer Segmentation:** Use Clustering (K-Means) to group churners into different categories for personalized marketing.
